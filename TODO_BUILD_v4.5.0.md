31. [ ] Update hardware wallet libraries (trezor, ledger-bitcoin, bitbox02)
32. [ ] Update build tools (setuptools 70.x, pip 24.x, wheel 0.43.x)

### Release Tasks
33. [ ] Upload binaries to GitHub releases
34. [ ] Create GitHub release v4.5.0 with release notes
35. [ ] Push release tag to GitHub

## Notes
- Using Python 3.11.9 instead of 3.12 for Wine compatibility
- Scrypt 0.9.4 successfully installed (critical for fast sync)
- Build currently in progress: Windows binary build
- All dependency updates should be tested thoroughly before release
- Verify compatibility with deterministic builds
- Test hardware wallet functionality after updates

## Testing Priority
1. Hardware wallet operations
2. Network connectivity and TLS
3. Blockchain synchronization
4. GUI functionality on all platforms
5. Build reproducibility
