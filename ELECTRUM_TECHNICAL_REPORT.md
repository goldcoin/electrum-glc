## Executive Summary

This report documents the comprehensive technical work completed on the Electrum-GLC wallet, the lightweight cryptocurrency wallet for Goldcoin (GLC). This development represents a critical component of the world's first AI-driven cryptocurrency, as outlined in the [Goldcoin Whitepaper](https://github.com/goldcoin/wiki/wiki/GoldCoin-Whitepaper).

The work encompasses enterprise-level deterministic build systems, critical bug fixes, and infrastructure preparations for the 2027 vision where Goldcoin becomes fully autonomous under AI management.

## 1. Project Context

### 1.1 The Goldcoin Vision
Goldcoin is pioneering the integration of AI governance in cryptocurrency, with:
- **AI-Managed Treasury**: 51% of block rewards allocated for autonomous project development
- **Decentralized AI Governance**: AI systems making strategic decisions
- **The 2027 Milestone**: Complete transition to AI-autonomous management

### 1.2 Electrum-GLC Role
The Electrum wallet serves as the primary lightweight wallet for Goldcoin users, providing:
- Fast synchronization using SPV (Simplified Payment Verification)
- Hardware wallet support (Ledger, Trezor, KeepKey, Coldcard, BitBox02)
- Multi-signature capabilities
- Deterministic key generation (BIP32/39/44)

## 2. Technical Achievements

### 2.1 Critical Bug Fixes

#### 2.1.1 Data Directory Naming Issue
**Problem**: Windows data directory was incorrectly named "ElectrumGLC" (missing dash)  
**Impact**: Configuration and wallet files stored in wrong location  
**Solution**: 
```python
# Fixed in electrum/util.py
elif "APPDATA" in os.environ:
    return os.path.join(os.environ["APPDATA"], "Electrum-GLC")  # Added dash
elif "LOCALAPPDATA" in os.environ:
    return os.path.join(os.environ["LOCALAPPDATA"], "Electrum-GLC")  # Added dash
```

#### 2.1.2 Blockchain Checkpoints Update
**Problem**: Empty checkpoints file causing slow initial synchronization  
**Solution**: Added 12 blockchain checkpoints to `electrum/checkpoints.json`:
```json
[
    ["00000000766bb896d862daf8c096207e8ac476d43b842f67d92e016e19e8f612", 260157],
    ["000000001e2a583c68bc51c5f087e23f5517dcb8f21c87b3e3a982b948e88e64", 520313],
    // ... 10 more checkpoints
]
```

### 2.2 Enterprise Deterministic Build System

#### 2.2.1 Architecture Overview
Created a complete enterprise-grade deterministic build system for reproducible builds:

```
contrib/deterministic-build/
├── build-deterministic.sh        # Main orchestrator
├── create_package_mirror.py      # Package mirror system
├── verify-build.py               # Build verification
├── generate-attestation.py       # Attestation generation
├── requirements*.txt             # Pinned dependencies
└── DETERMINISTIC_BUILD_DESIGN.md # Complete design documentation
```

#### 2.2.2 Key Features
- **Temporal Determinism**: Fixed SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=1000000000
- **Docker Isolation**: Consistent build environment
- **Package Mirroring**: Local cache of all dependencies with SHA256 verification
- **Multi-user Support**: Unique Docker naming for shared server environments
- **Build Attestation**: Cryptographic proof of build integrity

#### 2.2.3 Build Process Flow
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Check Prerequisites] --> B[Setup Directories]
    B --> C[Create Package Mirror]
    C --> D[Prepare Build Context]
    D --> E[Build Docker Image]
    E --> F[Run Wine Build]
    F --> G[Generate Windows Executables]
    G --> H[Verify Build]
    H --> I[Generate Attestation]
```

### 2.3 Wine Build System Fixes

#### 2.3.1 Pip/Setuptools Hash Mismatch
**Problem**: pip==24.0 and setuptools==69.0.3 wheel hashes differed from source distributions  
**Solution**: Created `install-requirements-deterministic.sh`:
```bash
# Install pip/setuptools from wheels
$WINE_PYTHON -m pip install --only-binary=pip,setuptools pip==24.0 setuptools==69.0.3

# Install remaining packages from source
$WINE_PYTHON -m pip install --no-binary :all: -r requirements-without-pip-setuptools.txt
```

#### 2.3.2 PyProject.toml Metadata Conflict
**Problem**: Conflicting metadata between pyproject.toml and setup.py  
**Solution**: 
- Added `readme` to dynamic fields in pyproject.toml
- Aligned package names between both files ("Electrum-GLC")
- Removed duplicate metadata definitions

### 2.4 Build Outputs

Successfully generated three Windows executables with deterministic builds:
